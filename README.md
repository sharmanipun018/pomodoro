## Introduction

Hello, developers! I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: a **Pomodoro Timer**. This project is perfect for anyone looking to enhance their time management skills or practice their front-end development. The Pomodoro Timer is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you break your work into focused intervals, improving productivity and maintaining focus throughout the day.

## Project Overview

The **Pomodoro Timer** is a web-based application that allows users to set a timer for focused work sessions, typically 25 minutes, followed by short breaks. This project demonstrates how to create a functional timer using JavaScript, along with a clean and responsive user interface with HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Simple Timer Interface**: A minimalist design that displays the countdown timer and controls.
- **Start, Stop, Reset**: Users can start, stop, and reset the timer with easy-to-use buttons.
- **Notification Alert**: An alert is triggered when the timer reaches zero, signaling the end of a session.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the Pomodoro Timer.
- **CSS**: Styles the timer, ensuring a clean and modern design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality of the timer, including countdown logic and user interactions.
